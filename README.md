<br><br>Download [Walmart Recruiting - Store Sales Forecasting](walmart-store-sales.zip) dataset here. 
<br><br>
### Data
You are provided with 3-years (2022-2024) sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments.
Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 
<br><br>
The dataset is available in three files. Here are the field descriptions for each of the files:
<br><br>

Within this file you will find the following fields:

- **Store** - the store number
- **Dept** - the department number
- **Date** - the week
- **Weekly_Sales** -  sales for the given department in the given store
- **IsHoliday** - whether the week is a special holiday week
<br><br>
